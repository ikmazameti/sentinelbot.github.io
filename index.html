    <p>Cycling is one of the most exciting sports activities that can become your fitness mantra. It not only helps in becoming physically fitter but also in mental well-being. While it helps you zoom past traffic, riding a bike for 20 minutes can burn up to 100 calories! The advantages of cycling are endless, however, it has some special benefits for women. Let’s find out!
<ol>
 <li> Cycling acts like an energy booster:
        An intense round of cycling may seem tiring in the end. However, it does the opposite! It actually works on building up your stamina and making you fitter. It helps in decreasing fatigue and triggers your brain to emit a neurotransmitter called dopamine, which releases energy. If you are a beginner at cycling, ride at your own pace initially. There is no hurry. Increase your pace and distance slowly. Remember, your goal is to maintain a constant pace and not cycle inconsistently.
 </li>
<li> Cycling saves your joints:
        We all know that the bone density in a woman’s body starts decreasing at a certain age. Cycling is an activity that involves movement in almost all of your joints. Knee, wrists, ankles and elbows are under constant effort while riding a bike. This helps in keeping your muscles and joints active and fit. Additionally, riding can help in lowering blood pressure and LDL cholesterol.
</li>
<li> Cycling reduces stress and pressure:
        Cycling is one of the most stress relieving activities of all times. It helps your heart pump blood smoothly in your body, running through joints, which help in easing body movement. If you wish to exercise to lose weight but also become stress-free, go out cycling and discover your #EverydayAdventure!
</li>
<li> It helps in your mental well-being:
        Cycling is a mood-booster. Riding a bike can instantly make you feel happier, lighter and energetic. It makes you more active and helps in maintaining body balance. Exploring new destinations beyond your neighbourhood, on a cycle also gives you a sense of independence.
</li>
</ol>
<p>Cycling is a very versatile sport. It can be as intense or as relaxing as you want it to be. If you are an adventurous woman looking for some fun, you should definitely go on relaxing rides! Just pick your helmet and set out on new a #EverydayAdventure! </p>
